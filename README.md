# Stardeus Mod Template

This is a mod template for [Stardeus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/).

It should be the definitive example for anything moddable in this game, and will be
extended over time to contain at least one example of any moddable aspect.

See subfolders for more readme files on how to create Artwork, and Definitions.

Best place to ask questions about modding Stardeus is on [Stardeus Discord](https://discord.com/invite/89amEwP), #stardeus-modding channel.

## How to compile a mod DLL with your code

If you're on Linux, please refer to [Linux Build Instruction instead.](Linux.md)

1. Make a copy of "stardeus-mod-template" folder, rename it to something else.
2. Edit `ModInfo.json` and change the `Id`, `Name`, `Description` and other fields.
3. Remove the `SteamWorkshopItemId` file.
4. Edit `.vscode/mod.csproj` line 14 to set the name of the DLL file your mod will produce.
5. Edit `.vscode/mod.csproj` line 31 to work with your system.
6. Edit `.vscode/launch.json` line 15 to work with your system.
7. Move the folder to the `Mods` directory near your `Saves`. You can open the folder from Stardeus itself, through `Main Menu > Mods > About Mods > Open User Mods Directory`.
8. Open the folder with `Visual Studio Code`.
9. Press `F5` to compile the DLL file and run Stardeus.
10. Once Stardeus starts, you should see your mod listed and enabled in `Main Menu > Mods`.

You may need to examine what's in .vscode directory and modify / create new
scripts there accordingly to what would work on your OS.

## Mod Development Tips

1. You can reduce the initial boot time by disabling texture compression. Run Stardeus.exe with `--uncompressed-textures` argument.
2. You can skip the main menu and load directly into a specific save file. Run Stardeus.exe with `--load-save "Save Dir/Game Name"` argument.
